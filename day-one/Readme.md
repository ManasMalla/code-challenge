# Day 1

## Problem 1: 
Given an array arr, the task is to find the largest element in it.

## Examples:

`Input: arr= [1, 8, 7, 56, 90]`
`Output: 90`

Explanation: The largest element of given array is 90.

`Input: arr = [5, 5, 5, 5]`
`Output: 5`

Explanation: The largest element of given array is 5.

`Input: arr = [10]`
`Output: 10`

Explanation: There is only one element which is the largest `

`Expected Time Complexity: O(n)`
`Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)`

Constraints:
`1 <= arr.size()<= 105`
`0 <= arri <= 105`

arr may contain duplicate elements. 

## Problem 2: 
Given an array arr, return the second largest distinct element from an array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

## Examples:

`Input: arr = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]`
`Output: 34`
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.

`Input: arr = [10, 10]`
`Output: -1`
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist so answer is -1.

`Expected Time Complexity: O(n)`
`Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)`

Constraints:
`2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105`
`1 ≤ arri ≤ 105`
